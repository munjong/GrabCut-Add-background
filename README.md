## Erase and insert background

We use the openCV library's Grabcut algorithm to erase the background and then add the new background we want.

### To Do

1.  To use the GrabCut algorithm, **find the code** in github. The code we found temporarily is in the link. This code is forked.  [Link](https://github.com/jaejin1/GrabCut)
2.  Once you have found the code, analyze and understand it. Then drag the image first to remove the object recognition behavior and **automatically modify** the object to recognize it.
3.  If you have perfectly deleted the background, the original function of the GrabCut is to completely erase the background to leave only the object. Then **add the function to receive the key and select the background**. The background is saved in advance.
4.  Finally, **if I have time**, I will make all of these functions into a web application. You will then be able to set the background and object pictures and get the results.
